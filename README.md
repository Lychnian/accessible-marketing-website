# Accessible Marketing Website


## Description
As a web-developer, I am refactoring the code of our clientâ€™s website to meet technological standards. My client is a marketing agency that requests that the website be accessible for technology used by persons with disabilities, in particular, the use  screen readers. Changes would include the following: 
- Organizing and Implementing CSS selectors that conform to the proper use of  semantic HTML elements
- Document follows a logical structure
- Images contain image alt attributes
- Heading attributes fall in sequential order
- Concise and descriptive title
